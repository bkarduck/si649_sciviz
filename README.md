This is for a SI 649 (Information Visualization) project. 

The data/visualization is taken from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7

To run this on streamlit, run the file: 'streamlit_final.py' in the command line by using streamlit run streamlit_final.py

If you want to control whether or not to use the dark or light mode (it defaults to your browser), use streamlit run streamlit_final.py --theme.base='light' or streamlit run streamlit_final.py --theme.base='dark'

I think it looks cool in either light or dark mode and it's easy to change the colors of the marks in order to customize it however you might want to. 

There are other sets of soccer data from the article, but I chose to use the European Championship (2016) as the data source as it had a reasonable amount of games to click through. 

The other batches of data are way larger in file size and would overcomplicate the visualization.

Enjoy!
